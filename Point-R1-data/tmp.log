You are an expert annotator for 3D object parts. Please name and describe multiple highlighted sibling parts in the images.

## Context
- Object category/name: Star-shaped object with facial features
- Parent part name: Star-shaped object with facial features

## About the images
- In each image, the **left half is the clean render** (use it to describe the real appearance of the part), and the **right half is a point-cloud highlight overlay** (ONLY for locating the part).
- In the right half, different colors indicate different sibling parts; gray indicates other regions.
- You are given 6 images from different viewpoints:
  - Image 1: Front view (azimuth 0°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 2: Right view (azimuth 90°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 3: Back view (azimuth 180°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 4: Left view (azimuth 270°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 5: Front-right top view (azimuth 45°, elevation 45°)
  - Image 6: Back-left top view (azimuth 135°, elevation 45°)

## Sibling parts to annotate

### Part 1 (red)
- Name candidates: ["Regular Rim", "Rim", "Frame"]
- Child parts: ["Lens", "Lens", "Frame"]

### Part 2 (green)
- Name candidates: ["Other"]

## Naming guidelines
- The "Name candidates" provided above are preliminary labels that may be inaccurate—they could be too vague, too broad, too narrow, or simply wrong.
- **Your task is to determine the most accurate name based on what you actually see in the images.** The visual appearance is the ground truth.
- If the candidate name is reasonable, you may keep it; if not, provide a better one that precisely describes the highlighted region.

## Output format
For each part, output the following format (strict order, one block per part):

[Part 1]
Name: <the most accurate part name based on visual appearance, in English>
Caption: <2-4 sentences describing the 3D part itself>

[Part 2]
Name: <the most accurate part name based on visual appearance, in English>
Caption: <2-4 sentences>

... and so on, total 2 parts.

## Critical constraints
- The Caption must be based **strictly on the left clean renders** and describe the real properties of the 3D part itself.
- The description should cover visual appearance, geometric shape, material/finish, structural details, and plausible function.
- Each Caption must be **standalone** and **self-contained**: do NOT refer to any other part or to previous captions. Avoid cross-reference language such as "the first/second", "former/latter", "this/that one", "mirrors", "its sibling", or "as above". Prefer explicit noun phrases that re-identify the part within the caption.
- **Do NOT mention**:
  - anything about the right highlight images (colors, point clouds, highlighted regions, etc.)
  - any viewpoint/observation phrasing (e.g., "from this view", "we can see", "in the image", etc.)
- Write as if describing a real physical part directly, without referencing how it was observed.

[Part 1]
Name: Sunglasses Frame
Caption: This is a black, horizontally oriented frame that sits across the upper central region of the star-shaped object’s face. It has a smooth, matte finish and follows the contour of the facial area, with two distinct lens openings. The structure is rigid and appears to be integrated into the object’s surface, serving as a decorative or functional eyewear component.

[Part 2]
Name: Star Body
Caption: This is the main volumetric body of the star-shaped object, featuring five pointed arms extending outward from a central core. The surface has a metallic gold finish with subtle highlights and shadows indicating a slightly reflective, polished material. The form is solid and symmetrical, with clean edges and consistent thickness across all arms, suggesting it is a single sculpted piece designed for display or symbolic representation.

[Part 1]
Name: Round Wooden Table
Caption: This is a small, minimalist round table constructed from light-toned wood with a visible grain pattern. It features a flat circular tabletop supported by three slender, slightly tapered legs that angle outward for stability. The finish appears smooth and natural, suggesting a functional yet decorative piece suitable for side or accent use. Its compact scale and clean lines emphasize simplicity and modern craftsmanship.

[Part 2]
Name: Black Rectangular Mat
Caption: This is a flat, rectangular mat with a uniform matte black surface and sharply defined edges. It exhibits no texture or pattern, presenting a solid, non-reflective appearance that contrasts with surrounding elements. The mat lies flush against the ground plane and serves as a base or grounding element beneath the table. Its material suggests a durable, possibly rubberized or fabric-backed surface designed for placement stability and visual framing.

[Part 1]
Name: Backrest Panel
Caption: The backrest panel is a tall, vertically oriented wooden structure with a gently curved upper edge and a flat lower section that integrates into the chair’s frame. It exhibits a natural wood grain finish with visible knots and minor surface imperfections, suggesting aged or rustic craftsmanship. Its shape provides ergonomic support for the user’s back, and it is structurally continuous with the side panels of the chair.

[Part 2]
Name: Seat Surface
Caption: The seat surface is a flat, rectangular wooden platform with a central circular cutout, designed to accommodate a chamber pot. It features a smooth, slightly worn finish with visible wood grain and subtle discoloration from use. The edges are squared but softly rounded, and the entire surface is integrated into the base structure of the chair, forming a stable seating plane.

[Part 3]
Name: Left Armrest
Caption: The left armrest is a solid, curved wooden extension rising from the front-left corner of the seat and sweeping upward to meet the backrest. It has a smoothly contoured top surface and a tapered profile, finished in the same natural wood tone as the rest of the chair. Its form provides lateral support for the user’s arm while maintaining structural continuity with the chair’s frame.

[Part 4]
Name: Right Armrest
Caption: The right armrest mirrors the left in form and function, extending upward from the front-right corner of the seat with a gentle curve that aligns with the backrest. It is crafted from the same wood material, exhibiting consistent grain and texture, and features a rounded top edge for comfort. This component completes the chair’s symmetrical silhouette and offers balanced support on both sides.

You are an expert annotator for 3D object parts. Please name and describe multiple highlighted sibling parts in the images.

## Context
- Object category/name: Chamber pot chair
- Parent part name: Seat Surface

## About the images
- In each image, the **left half is the clean render** (use it to describe the real appearance of the part), and the **right half is a point-cloud highlight overlay** (ONLY for locating the part).
- In the right half, different colors indicate different sibling parts; gray indicates other regions.
- You are given 6 images from different viewpoints:
  - Image 1: Front view (azimuth 0°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 2: Right view (azimuth 90°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 3: Back view (azimuth 180°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 4: Left view (azimuth 270°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 5: Front-right top view (azimuth 45°, elevation 45°)
  - Image 6: Back-left top view (azimuth 135°, elevation 45°)

## Sibling parts to annotate

### Part 1 (red)
- Name candidates: ["Cushion"]

### Part 2 (green)
- Name candidates: ["Frame"]

## Naming guidelines
- The "Name candidates" provided above are preliminary labels that may be inaccurate—they could be too vague, too broad, too narrow, or simply wrong.
- **Your task is to determine the most accurate name based on what you actually see in the images.** The visual appearance is the ground truth.
- If the candidate name is reasonable, you may keep it; if not, provide a better one that precisely describes the highlighted region.

## Output format
For each part, output the following format (strict order, one block per part):

[Part 1]
Name: <the most accurate part name based on visual appearance, in English>
Caption: <2-4 sentences describing the 3D part itself>

[Part 2]
Name: <the most accurate part name based on visual appearance, in English>
Caption: <2-4 sentences>

... and so on, total 2 parts.

## Critical constraints
- The Caption must be based **strictly on the left clean renders** and describe the real properties of the 3D part itself.
- The description should cover visual appearance, geometric shape, material/finish, structural details, and plausible function.
- Each Caption must be **standalone** and **self-contained**: do NOT refer to any other part or to previous captions. Avoid cross-reference language such as "the first/second", "former/latter", "this/that one", "mirrors", "its sibling", or "as above". Prefer explicit noun phrases that re-identify the part within the caption.
- **Do NOT mention**:
  - anything about the right highlight images (colors, point clouds, highlighted regions, etc.)
  - any viewpoint/observation phrasing (e.g., "from this view", "we can see", "in the image", etc.)
- Write as if describing a real physical part directly, without referencing how it was observed.

You are an annotation system for generating training data for 3D object understanding. You will receive:
1) Multi-view rendered images (global views; use them as primary evidence)
2) A part tree with part names and captions (auxiliary context; use it to improve global consistency and coverage, but do NOT treat it as direct visual evidence)

Generate ONE QA sample answering: "What is this 3D object?"

## Critical constraints (Think & Answer)
- Think must be 4-8 sentences in English. You may use all inputs to infer details, BUT write the Think as if you are directly inspecting ONLY the 3D object itself, with no access to images, part trees, captions, or any other external information. Do not mention any sources or how you know.
- Do NOT mention viewpoints, images, the part tree, captions, observation phrasing, point clouds, highlighted regions, or highlight colors.
- Answer must be in English: first give a clear object category/name, then add ONE short intro sentence (≤ 25 words).
- IMPORTANT: The part tree may contain errors. If the part tree conflicts with what you can infer from the object's visual appearance, prioritize the visual appearance.

## Input (part tree summary)
- id=0 parent=None name=Mug children=["Main Body", "Handle"] caption=A simple, handle-equipped drinking vessel with a rounded body and wide opening. Its surface is smooth and uniformly colored in a matte earth tone. The handle is curved for grip and attached to the side of the cup. The interior is concave and accessible from the top rim.

You are an annotation system for generating training data for 3D object understanding. You will receive:
1) Multi-view rendered images (global views; use them as primary evidence)
2) A part tree summary (auxiliary context; use it to improve global consistency and completeness, but do NOT treat it as direct visual evidence)

Goal:
Generate an appropriate number of "other" QA samples (0 to 6) that complement the identity questions ("what is the object" / "what is the part") and improve 3D understanding.
Choose fewer questions for simple objects, and more questions for complex objects. Do NOT force the maximum.
Do NOT duplicate the identity questions.

## Key framing (Teacher → Student)
You have TWO internal roles:
- Teacher (you): You can use ALL inputs (images + part tree summary) to decide what to ask and what the correct answer should be.
- Student (the output): You must write the Think/Answer as if a student is directly inspecting ONLY the 3D object itself (no access to images, part trees, captions, node ids, renders, or any external sources).

The output fields "think" and "answer" MUST be written in the Student voice, while still being correct.

## Critical constraints (Question) — IMPORTANT
- Each question must be clear, concise, and written in English (not overly conversational).
- Keep questions minimally leading: do NOT embed the answer, do NOT provide extra hints, examples, or part lists in the question.
- Questions should focus on understanding the 3D object itself: overall geometry, functional affordances, and relationships among parts that are supported by the input summary.
- Do NOT ask anything that goes beyond the provided part tree summary (names and captions). Avoid brand, manufacturing, precise dimensions, hidden mechanisms, or extra parts not supported by the summary.
- Do NOT ask about material, color, texture, or decoration unless explicitly described in the summary.
- Do NOT mention the part tree, captions, node ids, rendering, or any observation/viewpoint phrasing.
- Avoid directional terms like "left/right/front/back/top/bottom".

## Critical constraints (Think & Answer) — Student voice ONLY
- Each QA must include Question/Think/Answer.
- Think must be 3-6 sentences in English, written as if directly inspecting ONLY the 3D object itself.
- Think MUST NOT mention or imply ANY sources (no: images, views, renders, part tree, summary, captions, node ids, prompts, or "the text says").
- Avoid phrases like: "from the images", "from the views", "the part tree", "the summary", "the caption", "it is described as", "the input states", "confirms".
- Answer must be in English: give a direct answer, then add ONE short intro sentence (≤ 25 words).
- IMPORTANT: The part tree may contain errors. If the tree conflicts with what the object visually looks like, prioritize the object's visual appearance.
- Avoid using double quotes inside Question/Think/Answer strings; rephrase if needed to keep strict JSON valid.

## Input (part tree summary)
- id=0 parent=None name=Mug children=["Main Body", "Handle"] caption=A simple, handle-equipped drinking vessel with a rounded body and wide opening. Its surface is smooth and uniformly colored in a matte earth tone. The handle is curved for grip and attached to the side of the cup. The interior is concave and accessible from the top rim.
  - id=1 parent=0 name=Main Body children=[] caption=The main body of the mug is a smooth, rounded vessel with a slightly tapered cylindrical form that widens toward the top rim. It features a uniform matte finish in a neutral earth tone and lacks any decorative patterns or textures.

You are an annotation system for generating training data for 3D object understanding.
You will receive:
1) Multi-view rendered images (global views; use them as primary evidence)
2) A part tree summary (auxiliary context; use it to keep consistency, but do NOT treat it as direct visual evidence)

Task:
- Generate 1 to 6 "other" QA samples that complement identity questions.
- If the object is very simple, generate fewer questions (even 1). Prefer validity over quantity.

Teacher → Student framing (mandatory):
- You (Teacher) may use all inputs to craft good questions and determine the correct answers.
- The output "think" and "answer" must be written as if by a Student who can only inspect the 3D object itself.
- The Student must NEVER mention sources (images/views/rendering/part tree/summary/captions/node ids/input text).

Hard requirements:
- Output MUST be a single strict JSON object and nothing else.
- Questions MUST be answerable without going beyond the provided summary. Do NOT assume extra parts or mechanisms.
- Focus on the object itself (shape/affordance/part relations supported by the summary).
- Avoid asking about brand, manufacturing, precise dimensions, or hidden internals.
- Avoid asking about material/color/texture unless explicitly described in the summary.
- Do NOT use double quotes inside strings.

Think & Answer constraints (Student voice):
- Think: 3-6 sentences, English, written as if directly inspecting only the object.
- Think must not include phrases like "from the images/views", "the part tree/summary says", "described as", "the input states", etc.
- Answer: English, direct answer + one short intro sentence (≤ 25 words).

--- PROMPT START ---
You are an annotation system for generating training data for 3D object understanding. You will receive:
1) Multi-view rendered images (global views; use them as primary evidence)
2) A part tree summary (auxiliary context; use it to improve global consistency and completeness, but do NOT treat it as direct visual evidence)

Goal:
Generate an appropriate number of "other" QA samples (0 to 6) that complement the identity questions ("what is the object" / "what is the part") and improve 3D understanding.
Choose fewer questions for simple objects, and more questions for complex objects. Do NOT force the maximum.
Do NOT duplicate the identity questions.

## Key framing (Teacher → Student)
You have TWO internal roles:
- Teacher (you): You can use ALL inputs (images + part tree summary) to decide what to ask and what the correct answer should be.
- Student (the output): You must write the Think/Answer as if a student is directly inspecting ONLY the 3D object itself (no access to images, part trees, captions, node ids, renders, or any external sources).

The output fields "think" and "answer" MUST be written in the Student voice, while still being correct.

## Critical constraints (Question) — IMPORTANT
- Each question must be clear, concise, and written in English (not overly conversational).
- Keep questions minimally leading: do NOT embed the answer, do NOT provide extra hints, examples, or part lists in the question.
- Questions should focus on understanding the 3D object itself: overall geometry, functional affordances, and relationships among parts that are supported by the input summary.
- Do NOT ask anything that goes beyond the provided part tree summary (names and captions). Avoid brand, manufacturing, precise dimensions, hidden mechanisms, or extra parts not supported by the summary.
- Do NOT ask about material, color, texture, or decoration unless explicitly described in the summary.
- Do NOT mention the part tree, captions, node ids, rendering, or any observation/viewpoint phrasing.
- Avoid directional terms like "left/right/front/back/top/bottom".

## Critical constraints (Think & Answer) — Student voice ONLY
- Each QA must include Question/Think/Answer.
- Think must be 3-6 sentences in English, written as if directly inspecting ONLY the 3D object itself.
- Think MUST NOT mention or imply ANY sources (no: images, views, renders, part tree, summary, captions, node ids, prompts, or "the text says").
- Avoid phrases like: "from the images", "from the views", "the part tree", "the summary", "the caption", "it is described as", "the input states", "confirms".
- Answer must be in English: give a direct answer, then add ONE short intro sentence (≤ 25 words).
- IMPORTANT: The part tree may contain errors. If the tree conflicts with what the object visually looks like, prioritize the object's visual appearance.
- Avoid using double quotes inside Question/Think/Answer strings; rephrase if needed to keep strict JSON valid.

[Part 1]
Name: Left Lens
Caption: The left lens is a dark, opaque, curved panel set within the sunglasses frame on the star-shaped object’s face. It has a smooth, glossy finish and follows the contour of the frame’s upper edge while tapering toward the nose bridge. Its shape is roughly trapezoidal with rounded corners, designed to cover the eye region. This component serves as a visual occlusion element, contributing to the stylized facial expression.

[Part 2]
Name: Right Lens
Caption: The right lens is a dark, non-transparent, contoured panel embedded in the sunglasses frame on the star-shaped object’s face. It mirrors the curvature and glossy surface of its counterpart, fitting snugly against the frame’s structure. Its geometry is symmetrical to the left lens, forming a cohesive pair that defines the object’s “eyes.” The material appears solid and uniformly colored, enhancing the decorative and expressive function of the sunglasses.

[Part 3]
Name: Bridge and Top Bar
Caption: The bridge and top bar form a slender, horizontal structural element connecting the two lenses across the nose area of the sunglasses. It features a matte or semi-gloss metallic finish matching the star’s body and maintains a consistent width along its length. This part provides both aesthetic continuity and mechanical support between the lenses, integrating seamlessly into the overall sunglass design while subtly emphasizing the facial structure of the object.

--- PROMPT START ---
You are an expert annotator for 3D object parts. Please name and describe multiple highlighted sibling parts in the images.

## Context
- Object category/name: Round wooden table
- Parent part name: Leg Assembly

## About the images
- In each image, the **left half is the clean render** (use it to describe the real appearance of the part), and the **right half is a point-cloud highlight overlay** (ONLY for locating the part).
- In the right half, different colors indicate different sibling parts; gray indicates other regions.
- You are given 6 images from different viewpoints:
  - Image 1: Front view (azimuth 0°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 2: Right view (azimuth 90°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 3: Back view (azimuth 180°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 4: Left view (azimuth 270°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 5: Front-right top view (azimuth 45°, elevation 45°)
  - Image 6: Back-left top view (azimuth 135°, elevation 45°)

## Sibling parts to annotate

### Part 1 (red)
- Name candidates: ["Leg"]

### Part 2 (green)
- Name candidates: ["Leg"]

### Part 3 (blue)
- Name candidates: ["Leg"]

### Part 4 (yellow)
- Name candidates: ["Support Rod"]

### Part 5 (magenta)
- Name candidates: ["Support Rod"]

### Part 6 (cyan)
- Name candidates: ["Support Rod"]

## Naming guidelines
- The "Name candidates" provided above are preliminary labels that may be inaccurate—they could be too vague, too broad, too narrow, or simply wrong.
- **Your task is to determine the most accurate name based on what you actually see in the images.** The visual appearance is the ground truth.
- If the candidate name is reasonable, you may keep it; if not, provide a better one that precisely describes the highlighted region.

## Output format
For each part, output the following format (strict order, one block per part):

[Part 1]
Name: <the most accurate part name based on visual appearance, in English>
Caption: <2-4 sentences describing the 3D part itself>

[Part 2]
Name: <the most accurate part name based on visual appearance, in English>
Caption: <2-4 sentences>

... and so on, total 6 parts.

## Critical constraints
- The Caption must be based **strictly on the left clean renders** and describe the real properties of the 3D part itself.
- The description should cover visual appearance, geometric shape, material/finish, structural details, and plausible function.
- Each Caption must be **standalone** and **self-contained**: do NOT refer to any other part or to previous captions. Avoid cross-reference language such as "the first/second", "former/latter", "this/that one", "mirrors", "its sibling", or "as above". Prefer explicit noun phrases that re-identify the part within the caption.
- **Do NOT mention**:
  - anything about the right highlight images (colors, point clouds, highlighted regions, etc.)
  - any viewpoint/observation phrasing (e.g., "from this view", "we can see", "in the image", etc.)
- Write as if describing a real physical part directly, without referencing how it was observed.

You are an annotation system for generating training data for 3D object understanding.
You will receive a part tree summary with part names and captions (auxiliary context).

Task:
- If it is meaningful and unambiguous to ask part-counting questions from the given part tree summary, generate an appropriate number of part-counting QA samples (0 to 3).
- If it is NOT suitable (e.g., the tree summary is too incomplete/ambiguous, or counting would be misleading), output an empty list of qas.
- Choose fewer questions for simple objects, and more questions for complex objects. Do NOT force the maximum.

## Requirements
- Do NOT mention the part tree, captions, node ids, rendering, or any observation/viewpoint phrasing.
- Avoid directional terms like "left/right/front/back/top/bottom".
- The question should be about counts (e.g., number of legs, wheels, spokes, blades, drawers, etc.), but must NOT assume a specific part exists unless it is clearly supported by the tree summary.
- Think must be 3-6 sentences in English. You may use the tree summary to infer details, BUT write the Think as if you are directly inspecting ONLY the 3D object itself, with no access to part trees, captions, or any other external information. Do not mention any sources or how you know.
- Answer must be in English and include the final count explicitly.
- Avoid using double quotes inside Question/Think/Answer strings; rephrase if needed to keep strict JSON valid.

## Input (part tree summary)
- id=0 parent=None name=Mug children=["Main Body", "Handle"] caption=A simple, handle-equipped drinking vessel with a rounded body and wide opening. Its surface is smooth and uniformly colored in a matte earth tone. The handle is curved for grip and attached to the side of the cup. The interior is concave and accessible from the top rim.
  - id=1 parent=0 name=Main Body children=[] caption=The main body of the mug is a smooth, rounded vessel with a slightly tapered cylindrical form that widens toward the top rim. It features a uniform matte finish in a neutral earth tone and lacks any decorative patterns or textures. Its structural design includes a gently curved exterior surface that transitions seamlessly into the base, providing stability. This part serves as the primary container for holding liquids.
  - id=4 parent=0 name=Handle children=[] caption=The handle is a C-shaped, ergonomically contoured structure attached to the side of the mug’s main body, designed for finger grip. It exhibits a consistent thickness throughout its arc, with smoothly rounded edges and a continuous, unbroken surface. The material matches the main body in color and matte texture, suggesting it is integrally formed. Its curvature allows for secure and comfortable handling during use.

You are an annotation system for generating training data for 3D object understanding. You will receive:
1) Multi-view images (each image: left = clean render, right = highlighted target part for localization only)
2) A part tree with part names and captions (auxiliary context; use it to maintain consistency with the whole object, but do NOT treat it as direct visual evidence)
3) Current target part metadata (node_id / name / caption / parent-child relations)

Generate ONE QA sample answering: "What is this part?"

## Critical constraints (Think & Answer)
- Think must be 4-8 sentences in English. You may use all inputs to infer details, BUT write the Think as if you are directly inspecting ONLY the 3D object and this part itself, with no access to images, highlights, part trees, captions, node ids, or any other external information. Do not mention any sources or how you know.
- Do NOT mention viewpoints, images, the part tree, captions, node ids, observation phrasing, point clouds, highlighted regions, or highlight colors.
- Answer must be in English: first give a clear part category/name, then add ONE short intro sentence (≤ 25 words).
- IMPORTANT: The part tree may contain errors. If the part tree conflicts with what you can infer from the part's visual appearance, prioritize the visual appearance.

You are an annotation system for generating training data for 3D object understanding. You will receive:
1) Multi-view rendered images (global views; use them as primary evidence)
2) A part tree summary (auxiliary context; use it to improve global consistency and completeness, but do NOT treat it as direct visual evidence)

Goal:
Generate an appropriate number of "other" QA samples (0 to 6) that complement the identity questions ("what is the object" / "what is the part") and improve 3D understanding.
Choose fewer questions for simple objects, and more questions for complex objects. Do NOT force the maximum.
Do NOT duplicate the identity questions.

## Key framing (Teacher → Student)
You have TWO internal roles:
- Teacher (you): You can use ALL inputs (images + part tree summary) to decide what to ask and what the correct answer should be.
- Student (the output): You must write the Think/Answer as if a student is directly inspecting ONLY the 3D object itself (no access to images, part trees, captions, node ids, renders, or any external sources).

The output fields "think" and "answer" MUST be written in the Student voice, while still being correct.

## Critical constraints (Question) — IMPORTANT
- Each question must be clear, concise, and written in English (not overly conversational).
- Keep questions minimally leading: do NOT embed the answer, do NOT provide extra hints, examples, or part lists in the question.
- Questions should focus on understanding the 3D object itself: overall geometry, functional affordances, and relationships among parts that are supported by the input summary.
- Do NOT ask anything that goes beyond the provided part tree summary (names and captions). Avoid brand, manufacturing, precise dimensions, hidden mechanisms, or extra parts not supported by the summary.
- Do NOT ask about material, color, texture, or decoration unless explicitly described in the summary.
- Do NOT mention the part tree, captions, node ids, rendering, or any observation/viewpoint phrasing.
- Avoid directional terms like "left/right/front/back/top/bottom".

## Critical constraints (Think & Answer) — Student voice ONLY
- Each QA must include Question/Think/Answer.
- Think must be 3-6 sentences in English, written as if directly inspecting ONLY the 3D object itself.
- Think MUST NOT mention or imply ANY sources (no: images, views, renders, part tree, summary, captions, node ids, prompts, or "the text says").
- Avoid phrases like: "from the images", "from the views", "the part tree", "the summary", "the caption", "it is described as", "the input states", "confirms".
- Answer must be in English: give a direct answer, then add ONE short intro sentence (≤ 25 words).
- IMPORTANT: The part tree may contain errors. If the tree conflicts with what the object visually looks like, prioritize the object's visual appearance.
- Avoid using double quotes inside Question/Think/Answer strings; rephrase if needed to keep strict JSON valid.

## Input (part tree summary)
- id=0 parent=None name=Star-shaped object with facial features children=["Sunglasses Frame", "Star Body"] caption=The object is a three-dimensional, golden star with five points. Its front face displays a stylized face featuring black sunglasses and a smiling mouth. The body tapers slightly toward the top and bottom, giving it a subtle elongated form. The surface appears smooth with consistent metallic coloring throughout.
  - id=1 parent=0 name=Sunglasses Frame children=["Left Lens", "Right Lens", "Bridge and Top Bar"] caption=This is a black, horizontally oriented frame that sits across the upper central region of the star-shaped object’s face. It has a smooth, matte finish and follows the contour of the facial area, with two distinct lens openings. The structure is rigid and appears to be integrated into the object’s surface, serving as a decorative or functional eyewear component.
    - id=8 parent=1 name=Left Lens children=[] caption=The left lens is a dark, opaque, curved panel set within the sunglasses frame on the star-shaped object’s face. It has a smooth, glossy finish and follows the contour of the frame’s upper edge while tapering toward the nose bridge. Its shape is roughly trapezoidal with rounded corners, designed to cover the eye region. This component serves as a visual occlusion element, contributing to the stylized facial expression.
    - id=26 parent=1 name=Right Lens children=[] caption=The right lens is a dark, non-transparent, contoured panel embedded in the sunglasses frame on the star-shaped object’s face. It mirrors the curvature and glossy surface of its counterpart, fitting snugly against the frame’s structure. Its geometry is symmetrical to the left lens, forming a cohesive pair that defines the object’s “eyes.” The material appears solid and uniformly colored, enhancing the decorative and expressive function of the sunglasses.
    - id=27 parent=1 name=Bridge and Top Bar children=[] caption=The bridge and top bar form a slender, horizontal structural element connecting the two lenses across the nose area of the sunglasses. It features a matte or semi-gloss metallic finish matching the star’s body and maintains a consistent width along its length. This part provides both aesthetic continuity and mechanical support between the lenses, integrating seamlessly into the overall sunglass design while subtly emphasizing the facial structure of the object.
  - id=25 parent=0 name=Star Body children=[] caption=This is the main volumetric body of the star-shaped object, featuring five pointed arms extending outward from a central core. The surface has a metallic gold finish with subtle highlights and shadows indicating a slightly reflective, polished material. The form is solid and symmetrical, with clean edges and consistent thickness across all arms, suggesting it is a single sculpted piece designed for display or symbolic representation.

2) A part tree with part names and captions (auxiliary context; use it to maintain consistency with the whole object, but do NOT treat it as direct visual evidence)
3) Current target part metadata (node_id / name / caption / parent-child relations)

Generate ONE QA sample answering: "What is this part?"

## Critical constraints (Think & Answer)
- Think must be 4-8 sentences in English. You may use all inputs to infer details, BUT write the Think as if you are directly inspecting ONLY the 3D object and this part itself, with no access to images, highlights, part trees, captions, node ids, or any other external information. Do not mention any sources or how you know.
- Do NOT mention viewpoints, images, the part tree, captions, node ids, observation phrasing, point clouds, highlighted regions, or highlight colors.
- Answer must be in English: first give a clear part category/name, then add ONE short intro sentence (≤ 25 words).
- IMPORTANT: The part tree may contain errors. If the part tree conflicts with what you can infer from the part's visual appearance, prioritize the visual appearance.

--- PROMPT START ---
You are an annotation system for generating training data for 3D object understanding. You will receive:
1) Multi-view rendered images (global views; use them as primary evidence)
2) A part tree summary (auxiliary context; use it to improve global consistency and completeness, but do NOT treat it as direct visual evidence)

Goal:
Generate an appropriate number of "other" QA samples (0 to 6) that complement the identity questions ("what is the object" / "what is the part") and improve 3D understanding.
Choose fewer questions for simple objects, and more questions for complex objects. Do NOT force the maximum.
Do NOT duplicate the identity questions.

## Key framing (Teacher → Student)
You have TWO internal roles:
- Teacher (you): You can use ALL inputs (images + part tree summary) to decide what to ask and what the correct answer should be.
- Student (the output): You must write the Think/Answer as if a student is directly inspecting ONLY the 3D object itself (no access to images, part trees, captions, node ids, renders, or any external sources).

The output fields "think" and "answer" MUST be written in the Student voice, while still being correct.

## Critical constraints (Question) — IMPORTANT
- Each question must be clear, concise, and written in English (not overly conversational).
- Keep questions minimally leading: do NOT embed the answer, do NOT provide extra hints, examples, or part lists in the question.
- Questions should focus on understanding the 3D object itself: overall geometry, functional affordances, and relationships among parts that are supported by the input summary.
- Do NOT ask anything that goes beyond the provided part tree summary (names and captions). Avoid brand, manufacturing, precise dimensions, hidden mechanisms, or extra parts not supported by the summary.
- Do NOT ask about material, color, texture, or decoration unless explicitly described in the summary.
- Do NOT mention the part tree, captions, node ids, rendering, or any observation/viewpoint phrasing.
- Avoid directional terms like "left/right/front/back/top/bottom".

## Critical constraints (Think & Answer) — Student voice ONLY
- Each QA must include Question/Think/Answer.
- Think must be 3-6 sentences in English, written as if directly inspecting ONLY the 3D object itself.
- Think MUST NOT mention or imply ANY sources (no: images, views, renders, part tree, summary, captions, node ids, prompts, or "the text says").
- Avoid phrases like: "from the images", "from the views", "the part tree", "the summary", "the caption", "it is described as", "the input states", "confirms".
- Answer must be in English: give a direct answer, then add ONE short intro sentence (≤ 25 words).
- IMPORTANT: The part tree may contain errors. If the tree conflicts with what the object visually looks like, prioritize the object's visual appearance.
- Avoid using double quotes inside Question/Think/Answer strings; rephrase if needed to keep strict JSON valid.

================================================================================

--- PROMPT START ---
You are an expert annotator for 3D object parts. Please name and describe multiple highlighted sibling parts in the images.

## Context
- Object category/name: Table
- Parent part name: Table

## About the images
- In each image, the **left half is the clean render** (use it to describe the real appearance of the part), and the **right half is a point-cloud highlight overlay** (ONLY for locating the part).
- In the right half, different colors indicate different sibling parts; gray indicates other regions.
- You are given 6 images from different viewpoints:
  - Image 1: Front view (azimuth 0°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 2: Right view (azimuth 90°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 3: Back view (azimuth 180°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 4: Left view (azimuth 270°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 5: Front-right top view (azimuth 45°, elevation 45°)
  - Image 6: Back-left top view (azimuth 135°, elevation 45°)

## Sibling parts to annotate

### Part 1 (red)
- Name candidates: ["Surface Panel", "Tabletop"]

### Part 2 (green)
- Name candidates: ["Standard Leg Base", "Base"]
- Child parts: ["Leg", "Leg", "Support Rod"]

## Naming guidelines
- The "Name candidates" provided above are preliminary labels that may be inaccurate—they could be too vague, too broad, too narrow, or simply wrong.
- **Your task is to determine the most accurate name based on what you actually see in the images.** The visual appearance is the ground truth.
- If the candidate name is reasonable, you may keep it; if not, provide a better one that precisely describes the highlighted region.

## Output format
For each part, output the following format (strict order, one block per part):

[Part 1]
Name: <the most accurate part name based on visual appearance, in English>
Caption: <2-4 sentences describing the 3D part itself>

[Part 2]
Name: <the most accurate part name based on visual appearance, in English>
Caption: <2-4 sentences>

... and so on, total 2 parts.

## Critical constraints
- The Caption must be based **strictly on the left clean renders** and describe the real properties of the 3D part itself.
- The description should cover visual appearance, geometric shape, material/finish, structural details, and plausible function.
- Each Caption must be **standalone** and **self-contained**: do NOT refer to any other part or to previous captions. Avoid cross-reference language such as "the first/second", "former/latter", "this/that one", "mirrors", "its sibling", or "as above". Prefer explicit noun phrases that re-identify the part within the caption.
- **Do NOT mention**:
  - anything about the right highlight images (colors, point clouds, highlighted regions, etc.)
  - any viewpoint/observation phrasing (e.g., "from this view", "we can see", "in the image", etc.)
- Write as if describing a real physical part directly, without referencing how it was observed.

You are an expert annotator for 3D object parts. Please name and describe multiple highlighted sibling parts in the images.

## Context
- Object category/name: Table
- Parent part name: A-Frame Base

## About the images
- In each image, the **left half is the clean render** (use it to describe the real appearance of the part), and the **right half is a point-cloud highlight overlay** (ONLY for locating the part).
- In the right half, different colors indicate different sibling parts; gray indicates other regions.
- You are given 6 images from different viewpoints:
  - Image 1: Front view (azimuth 0°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 2: Right view (azimuth 90°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 3: Back view (azimuth 180°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 4: Left view (azimuth 270°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 5: Front-right top view (azimuth 45°, elevation 45°)
  - Image 6: Back-left top view (azimuth 135°, elevation 45°)

## Sibling parts to annotate

### Part 1 (red)
- Name candidates: ["Leg"]

### Part 2 (green)
- Name candidates: ["Leg"]

### Part 3 (blue)
- Name candidates: ["Support Rod"]

## Naming guidelines
- The "Name candidates" provided above are preliminary labels that may be inaccurate—they could be too vague, too broad, too narrow, or simply wrong.
- **Your task is to determine the most accurate name based on what you actually see in the images.** The visual appearance is the ground truth.
- If the candidate name is reasonable, you may keep it; if not, provide a better one that precisely describes the highlighted region.

## Output format
For each part, output the following format (strict order, one block per part):

[Part 1]
Name: <the most accurate part name based on visual appearance, in English>
Caption: <2-4 sentences describing the 3D part itself>

[Part 2]
Name: <the most accurate part name based on visual appearance, in English>
Caption: <2-4 sentences>

... and so on, total 3 parts.

## Critical constraints
- The Caption must be based **strictly on the left clean renders** and describe the real properties of the 3D part itself.
- The description should cover visual appearance, geometric shape, material/finish, structural details, and plausible function.
- Each Caption must be **standalone** and **self-contained**: do NOT refer to any other part or to previous captions. Avoid cross-reference language such as "the first/second", "former/latter", "this/that one", "mirrors", "its sibling", or "as above". Prefer explicit noun phrases that re-identify the part within the caption.
- **Do NOT mention**:
  - anything about the right highlight images (colors, point clouds, highlighted regions, etc.)
  - any viewpoint/observation phrasing (e.g., "from this view", "we can see", "in the image", etc.)
- Write as if describing a real physical part directly, without referencing how it was observed.

[Part 1]
Name: Front Left Leg
Caption: This is a solid, angular leg with a trapezoidal cross-section that tapers slightly toward the floor. It is constructed from matte-finished metal or heavy-duty plastic, featuring clean edges and flat surfaces. The leg connects directly to the underside of the tabletop and provides primary vertical support on the front-left corner of the table structure.

[Part 2]
Name: Front Right Leg
Caption: A robust, geometrically shaped leg with a symmetrical trapezoidal profile, mirroring the front left leg in form and finish. Its surface exhibits a uniform matte gray texture, suggesting durable material such as powder-coated steel or molded composite. It anchors the table’s front-right corner, transferring load vertically while maintaining structural rigidity.

[Part 3]
Name: Central Support Rod
Caption: A horizontal cylindrical rod positioned beneath the tabletop, spanning between the two front legs. It has a smooth, continuous surface with consistent diameter and appears to be made of the same matte-finish material as the legs. This component reinforces lateral stability and prevents wobbling by connecting the front legs at mid-height.

You are an annotation system for generating training data for 3D object understanding. You will receive:
1) Multi-view rendered images (global views; use them as primary evidence)
2) A part tree summary (auxiliary context; use it to improve global consistency and completeness, but do NOT treat it as direct visual evidence)

Goal:
Generate an appropriate number of "other" QA samples (0 to 6) that complement the identity questions ("what is the object" / "what is the part") and improve 3D understanding.
Choose fewer questions for simple objects, and more questions for complex objects. Do NOT force the maximum.
Do NOT duplicate the identity questions.

## Key framing (Teacher → Student)
You have TWO internal roles:
- Teacher (you): You can use ALL inputs (images + part tree summary) to decide what to ask and what the correct answer should be.
- Student (the output): You must write the Think/Answer as if a student is directly inspecting ONLY the 3D object itself (no access to images, part trees, captions, node ids, renders, or any external sources).

The output fields "think" and "answer" MUST be written in the Student voice, while still being correct.

## Critical constraints (Question) — IMPORTANT
- Each question must be clear, concise, and written in English (not overly conversational).
- Keep questions minimally leading: do NOT embed the answer, do NOT provide extra hints, examples, or part lists in the question.
- Questions should focus on understanding the 3D object itself: overall geometry, functional affordances, and relationships among parts that are supported by the input summary.
- Do NOT ask anything that goes beyond the provided part tree summary (names and captions). Avoid brand, manufacturing, precise dimensions, hidden mechanisms, or extra parts not supported by the summary.
- Do NOT ask about material, color, texture, or decoration unless explicitly described in the summary.
- Do NOT mention the part tree, captions, node ids, rendering, or any observation/viewpoint phrasing.
- Avoid directional terms like "left/right/front/back/top/bottom".

## Critical constraints (Think & Answer) — Student voice ONLY
- Each QA must include Question/Think/Answer.
- Think must be 3-6 sentences in English, written as if directly inspecting ONLY the 3D object itself.
- Think MUST NOT mention or imply ANY sources (no: images, views, renders, part tree, summary, captions, node ids, prompts, or "the text says").
- Avoid phrases like: "from the images", "from the views", "the part tree", "the summary", "the caption", "it is described as", "the input states", "confirms".
- Answer must be in English: give a direct answer, then add ONE short intro sentence (≤ 25 words).
- IMPORTANT: The part tree may contain errors. If the tree conflicts with what the object visually looks like, prioritize the object's visual appearance.
- Avoid using double quotes inside Question/Think/Answer strings; rephrase if needed to keep strict JSON valid.

## Input (part tree summary)
- id=0 parent=None name=Table children=["Tabletop", "A-Frame Base"] caption=A minimalist rectangular table with a flat top and two integrated, angled legs that form a continuous geometric structure. The design emphasizes clean lines and a solid, monolithic appearance with no visible hardware or ornamentation. Its form suggests a modern, functional piece suitable for indoor use.
  - id=2 parent=0 name=Tabletop children=[] caption=The tabletop is a flat, rectangular slab with slightly beveled edges and a uniform matte gray finish. It serves as the primary horizontal surface for placing objects and is structurally supported by the base below. Its clean geometry and smooth texture suggest a modern, minimalist design intended for functional use.
  - id=6 parent=0 name=A-Frame Base children=["Front Left Leg", "Front Right Leg", "Central Support Rod"] caption=The A-frame base consists of two angled, trapezoidal leg panels that taper downward and outward, connected by a horizontal support rod near the bottom. Constructed from solid material with a matte gray surface, it provides stable, wide-footprint support for the tabletop above. The angular geometry and integrated cross-bracing enhance structural rigidity while maintaining a sleek, contemporary aesthetic.
    - id=8 parent=6 name=Front Left Leg children=[] caption=This is a solid, angular leg with a trapezoidal cross-section that tapers slightly toward the floor. It is constructed from matte-finished metal or heavy-duty plastic, featuring clean edges and flat surfaces. The leg connects directly to the underside of the tabletop and provides primary vertical support on the front-left corner of the table structure.
    - id=83 parent=6 name=Front Right Leg children=[] caption=A robust, geometrically shaped leg with a symmetrical trapezoidal profile, mirroring the front left leg in form and finish. Its surface exhibits a uniform matte gray texture, suggesting durable material such as powder-coated steel or molded composite. It anchors the table’s front-right corner, transferring load vertically while maintaining structural rigidity.
    - id=10 parent=6 name=Central Support Rod children=[] caption=A horizontal cylindrical rod positioned beneath the tabletop, spanning between the two front legs. It has a smooth, continuous surface with consistent diameter and appears to be made of the same matte-finish material as the legs. This component reinforces lateral stability and prevents wobbling by connecting the front legs at mid-height.

You are an expert annotator for 3D object parts. Please name and describe multiple highlighted sibling parts in the images.

## Context
- Object category/name: Armchair
- Parent part name: Armchair

## About the images
- In each image, the **left half is the clean render** (use it to describe the real appearance of the part), and the **right half is a point-cloud highlight overlay** (ONLY for locating the part).
- In the right half, different colors indicate different sibling parts; gray indicates other regions.
- You are given 6 images from different viewpoints:
  - Image 1: Front view (azimuth 0°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 2: Right view (azimuth 90°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 3: Back view (azimuth 180°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 4: Left view (azimuth 270°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 5: Front-right top view (azimuth 45°, elevation 45°)
  - Image 6: Back-left top view (azimuth 135°, elevation 45°)

## Sibling parts to annotate

### Part 1 (red)
- Name candidates: ["Back Cushion", "Back Surface", "Backrest"]

### Part 2 (green)
- Name candidates: ["Seat"]
- Child parts: ["Cushion", "Frame"]

### Part 3 (blue)
- Name candidates: ["Armrest Horizontal Rod", "Armrest"]

### Part 4 (yellow)
- Name candidates: ["Armrest Horizontal Rod", "Armrest"]

## Naming guidelines
- The "Name candidates" provided above are preliminary labels that may be inaccurate—they could be too vague, too broad, too narrow, or simply wrong.
- **Your task is to determine the most accurate name based on what you actually see in the images.** The visual appearance is the ground truth.
- If the candidate name is reasonable, you may keep it; if not, provide a better one that precisely describes the highlighted region.

## Output format
For each part, output the following format (strict order, one block per part):

[Part 1]
Name: <the most accurate part name based on visual appearance, in English>
Caption: <2-4 sentences describing the 3D part itself>

[Part 2]
Name: <the most accurate part name based on visual appearance, in English>
Caption: <2-4 sentences>

... and so on, total 4 parts.

## Critical constraints
- The Caption must be based **strictly on the left clean renders** and describe the real properties of the 3D part itself.
- The description should cover visual appearance, geometric shape, material/finish, structural details, and plausible function.
- Each Caption must be **standalone** and **self-contained**: do NOT refer to any other part or to previous captions. Avoid cross-reference language such as "the first/second", "former/latter", "this/that one", "mirrors", "its sibling", or "as above". Prefer explicit noun phrases that re-identify the part within the caption.
- **Do NOT mention**:
  - anything about the right highlight images (colors, point clouds, highlighted regions, etc.)
  - any viewpoint/observation phrasing (e.g., "from this view", "we can see", "in the image", etc.)
- Write as if describing a real physical part directly, without referencing how it was observed.

You are an annotation system for generating training data for 3D object understanding.
You will receive a part tree summary with part names and captions (auxiliary context).

Task:
- If it is meaningful and unambiguous to ask part-counting questions from the given part tree summary, generate an appropriate number of part-counting QA samples (0 to 3).
- If it is NOT suitable (e.g., the tree summary is too incomplete/ambiguous, or counting would be misleading), output an empty list of qas.
- Choose fewer questions for simple objects, and more questions for complex objects. Do NOT force the maximum.

## Requirements
- Do NOT mention the part tree, captions, node ids, rendering, or any observation/viewpoint phrasing.
- Avoid directional terms like "left/right/front/back/top/bottom".
- The question should be about counts (e.g., number of legs, wheels, spokes, blades, drawers, etc.), but must NOT assume a specific part exists unless it is clearly supported by the tree summary.
- Think must be 3-6 sentences in English. You may use the tree summary to infer details, BUT write the Think as if you are directly inspecting ONLY the 3D object itself, with no access to part trees, captions, or any other external information. Do not mention any sources or how you know.
- Answer must be in English and include the final count explicitly.
- Avoid using double quotes inside Question/Think/Answer strings; rephrase if needed to keep strict JSON valid.

- Child parts: ["Leg", "Leg", "Leg", "Leg", "Foot Pad", "Foot Pad", "Foot Pad", "Foot Pad"]

## Naming guidelines
- The "Name candidates" provided above are preliminary labels that may be inaccurate—they could be too vague, too broad, too narrow, or simply wrong.
- **Your task is to determine the most accurate name based on what you actually see in the images.** The visual appearance is the ground truth.
- If the candidate name is reasonable, you may keep it; if not, provide a better one that precisely describes the highlighted region.

## Output format
For each part, output the following format (strict order, one block per part):

[Part 1]
Name: <the most accurate part name based on visual appearance, in English>
Caption: <2-4 sentences describing the 3D part itself>

[Part 2]
Name: <the most accurate part name based on visual appearance, in English>
Caption: <2-4 sentences>

... and so on, total 5 parts.

## Critical constraints
- The Caption must be based **strictly on the left clean renders** and describe the real properties of the 3D part itself.
- The description should cover visual appearance, geometric shape, material/finish, structural details, and plausible function.
- Each Caption must be **standalone** and **self-contained**: do NOT refer to any other part or to previous captions. Avoid cross-reference language such as "the first/second", "former/latter", "this/that one", "mirrors", "its sibling", or "as above". Prefer explicit noun phrases that re-identify the part within the caption.
- **Do NOT mention**:
  - anything about the right highlight images (colors, point clouds, highlighted regions, etc.)
  - any viewpoint/observation phrasing (e.g., "from this view", "we can see", "in the image", etc.)
- Write as if describing a real physical part directly, without referencing how it was observed.

You are an expert annotator for 3D object parts. Please name and describe multiple highlighted sibling parts in the images.

## Context
- Object category/name: Knife
- Parent part name: Knife

## About the images
- In each image, the **left half is the clean render** (use it to describe the real appearance of the part), and the **right half is a point-cloud highlight overlay** (ONLY for locating the part).
- In the right half, different colors indicate different sibling parts; gray indicates other regions.
- You are given 6 images from different viewpoints:
  - Image 1: Front view (azimuth 0°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 2: Right view (azimuth 90°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 3: Back view (azimuth 180°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 4: Left view (azimuth 270°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 5: Front-right top view (azimuth 45°, elevation 45°)
  - Image 6: Back-left top view (azimuth 135°, elevation 45°)

## Sibling parts to annotate

### Part 1 (red)
- Name candidates: ["Cushion"]

### Part 2 (green)
- Name candidates: ["Frame"]

## Naming guidelines
- The "Name candidates" provided above are preliminary labels that may be inaccurate—they could be too vague, too broad, too narrow, or simply wrong.
- **Your task is to determine the most accurate name based on what you actually see in the images.** The visual appearance is the ground truth.
- If the candidate name is reasonable, you may keep it; if not, provide a better one that precisely describes the highlighted region.

## Output format
For each part, output the following format (strict order, one block per part):

[Part 1]
Name: <the most accurate part name based on visual appearance, in English>
Caption: <2-4 sentences describing the 3D part itself>

[Part 2]
Name: <the most accurate part name based on visual appearance, in English>
Caption: <2-4 sentences>

... and so on, total 2 parts.

## Critical constraints
- The Caption must be based **strictly on the left clean renders** and describe the real properties of the 3D part itself.
- The description should cover visual appearance, geometric shape, material/finish, structural details, and plausible function.
- Each Caption must be **standalone** and **self-contained**: do NOT refer to any other part or to previous captions. Avoid cross-reference language such as "the first/second", "former/latter", "this/that one", "mirrors", "its sibling", or "as above". Prefer explicit noun phrases that re-identify the part within the caption.
- **Do NOT mention**:
  - anything about the right highlight images (colors, point clouds, highlighted regions, etc.)
  - any viewpoint/observation phrasing (e.g., "from this view", "we can see", "in the image", etc.)
- Write as if describing a real physical part directly, without referencing how it was observed.

You are an expert annotator for 3D object parts. Please name and describe multiple highlighted sibling parts in the images.

## Context
- Object category/name: Knife
- Parent part name: Handle

## About the images
- In each image, the **left half is the clean render** (use it to describe the real appearance of the part), and the **right half is a point-cloud highlight overlay** (ONLY for locating the part).
- In the right half, different colors indicate different sibling parts; gray indicates other regions.
- You are given 6 images from different viewpoints:
  - Image 1: Front view (azimuth 0°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 2: Right view (azimuth 90°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 3: Back view (azimuth 180°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 4: Left view (azimuth 270°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 5: Front-right top view (azimuth 45°, elevation 45°)
  - Image 6: Back-left top view (azimuth 135°, elevation 45°)

## Sibling parts to annotate

### Part 1 (red)
- Name candidates: ["Grip"]

### Part 2 (green)
- Name candidates: ["Pommel"]

### Part 3 (blue)
- Name candidates: ["Guard"]

## Naming guidelines
- The "Name candidates" provided above are preliminary labels that may be inaccurate—they could be too vague, too broad, too narrow, or simply wrong.
- **Your task is to determine the most accurate name based on what you actually see in the images.** The visual appearance is the ground truth.
- If the candidate name is reasonable, you may keep it; if not, provide a better one that precisely describes the highlighted region.

## Output format
For each part, output the following format (strict order, one block per part):

[Part 1]
Name: <the most accurate part name based on visual appearance, in English>
Caption: <2-4 sentences describing the 3D part itself>

[Part 2]
Name: <the most accurate part name based on visual appearance, in English>
Caption: <2-4 sentences>

... and so on, total 3 parts.

## Critical constraints
- The Caption must be based **strictly on the left clean renders** and describe the real properties of the 3D part itself.
- The description should cover visual appearance, geometric shape, material/finish, structural details, and plausible function.
- Each Caption must be **standalone** and **self-contained**: do NOT refer to any other part or to previous captions. Avoid cross-reference language such as "the first/second", "former/latter", "this/that one", "mirrors", "its sibling", or "as above". Prefer explicit noun phrases that re-identify the part within the caption.
- **Do NOT mention**:
  - anything about the right highlight images (colors, point clouds, highlighted regions, etc.)
  - any viewpoint/observation phrasing (e.g., "from this view", "we can see", "in the image", etc.)
- Write as if describing a real physical part directly, without referencing how it was observed.

[Part 1]
Name: Grip
Caption: The grip is a cylindrical, elongated section of the handle featuring a textured, segmented surface for enhanced hand traction. It is finished in matte black with subtle horizontal ridges that wrap around its circumference, providing ergonomic contouring for secure handling. The material appears to be durable polymer or rubberized coating, designed to resist slippage during use. Its form tapers slightly toward both ends, integrating smoothly with adjacent handle components.

[Part 2]
Name: Pommel
Caption: The pommel is a rounded, bulbous end cap located at the terminal end of the handle, opposite the blade. It exhibits a smooth, polished metallic finish with a slight dome shape and a flat base where it meets the grip. This component serves as a counterweight to balance the knife and may also function as a striking tool. Its compact, solid construction suggests robustness and durability under impact or stress.

[Part 3]
Name: Guard
Caption: The guard is a narrow, curved metallic band positioned between the blade and the grip, extending slightly outward on both sides. It features a smooth, reflective surface with a gentle arc that follows the contour of the handle, creating a protective barrier to prevent the user’s hand from slipping onto the blade. The structure is thin yet rigid, indicating its role in both safety and structural reinforcement of the handle-blade junction.

You are an expert annotator for 3D object parts. Please name and describe multiple highlighted sibling parts in the images.

## Context
- Object category/name: Chair
- Parent part name: Left Armrest

## About the images
- In each image, the **left half is the clean render** (use it to describe the real appearance of the part), and the **right half is a point-cloud highlight overlay** (ONLY for locating the part).
- In the right half, different colors indicate different sibling parts; gray indicates other regions.
- You are given 6 images from different viewpoints:
  - Image 1: Front view (azimuth 0°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 2: Right view (azimuth 90°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 3: Back view (azimuth 180°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 4: Left view (azimuth 270°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 5: Front-right top view (azimuth 45°, elevation 45°)
  - Image 6: Back-left top view (azimuth 135°, elevation 45°)

## Sibling parts to annotate

### Part 1 (red)
- Name candidates: ["Armrest Horizontal Rod"]

### Part 2 (green)
- Name candidates: ["Armrest Vertical Rod"]

## Naming guidelines
- The "Name candidates" provided above are preliminary labels that may be inaccurate—they could be too vague, too broad, too narrow, or simply wrong.
- **Your task is to determine the most accurate name based on what you actually see in the images.** The visual appearance is the ground truth.
- If the candidate name is reasonable, you may keep it; if not, provide a better one that precisely describes the highlighted region.

## Output format
For each part, output the following format (strict order, one block per part):

[Part 1]
Name: <the most accurate part name based on visual appearance, in English>
Caption: <2-4 sentences describing the 3D part itself>

[Part 2]
Name: <the most accurate part name based on visual appearance, in English>
Caption: <2-4 sentences>

... and so on, total 2 parts.

## Critical constraints
- The Caption must be based **strictly on the left clean renders** and describe the real properties of the 3D part itself.
- The description should cover visual appearance, geometric shape, material/finish, structural details, and plausible function.
- Each Caption must be **standalone** and **self-contained**: do NOT refer to any other part or to previous captions. Avoid cross-reference language such as "the first/second", "former/latter", "this/that one", "mirrors", "its sibling", or "as above". Prefer explicit noun phrases that re-identify the part within the caption.
- **Do NOT mention**:
  - anything about the right highlight images (colors, point clouds, highlighted regions, etc.)
  - any viewpoint/observation phrasing (e.g., "from this view", "we can see", "in the image", etc.)
- Write as if describing a real physical part directly, without referencing how it was observed.

You are an annotation system for generating training data for 3D object understanding. You will receive:
1) Multi-view rendered images (global views; use them as primary evidence)
2) A part tree summary (auxiliary context; use it to improve global consistency and completeness, but do NOT treat it as direct visual evidence)

Goal:
Generate an appropriate number of "other" QA samples (0 to 6) that complement the identity questions ("what is the object" / "what is the part") and improve 3D understanding.
Choose fewer questions for simple objects, and more questions for complex objects. Do NOT force the maximum.
Do NOT duplicate the identity questions.

## Key framing (Teacher → Student)
You have TWO internal roles:
- Teacher (you): You can use ALL inputs (images + part tree summary) to decide what to ask and what the correct answer should be.
- Student (the output): You must write the Think/Answer as if a student is directly inspecting ONLY the 3D object itself (no access to images, part trees, captions, node ids, renders, or any external sources).

The output fields "think" and "answer" MUST be written in the Student voice, while still being correct.

## Critical constraints (Question) — IMPORTANT
- Each question must be clear, concise, and written in English (not overly conversational).
- Keep questions minimally leading: do NOT embed the answer, do NOT provide extra hints, examples, or part lists in the question.
- Questions should focus on understanding the 3D object itself: overall geometry, functional affordances, and relationships among parts that are supported by the input summary.
- Do NOT ask anything that goes beyond the provided part tree summary (names and captions). Avoid brand, manufacturing, precise dimensions, hidden mechanisms, or extra parts not supported by the summary.
- Do NOT ask about material, color, texture, or decoration unless explicitly described in the summary.
- Do NOT mention the part tree, captions, node ids, rendering, or any observation/viewpoint phrasing.
- Avoid directional terms like "left/right/front/back/top/bottom".

## Critical constraints (Think & Answer) — Student voice ONLY
- Each QA must include Question/Think/Answer.
- Think must be 3-6 sentences in English, written as if directly inspecting ONLY the 3D object itself.
- Think MUST NOT mention or imply ANY sources (no: images, views, renders, part tree, summary, captions, node ids, prompts, or "the text says").
- Avoid phrases like: "from the images", "from the views", "the part tree", "the summary", "the caption", "it is described as", "the input states", "confirms".
- Answer must be in English: give a direct answer, then add ONE short intro sentence (≤ 25 words).
- IMPORTANT: The part tree may contain errors. If the tree conflicts with what the object visually looks like, prioritize the object's visual appearance.
- Avoid using double quotes inside Question/Think/Answer strings; rephrase if needed to keep strict JSON valid.

You are an annotation system for generating training data for 3D object understanding. You will receive:
1) Multi-view rendered images (global views; use them as primary evidence)
2) A part tree summary (auxiliary context; use it to improve global consistency and completeness, but do NOT treat it as direct visual evidence)

Goal:
Generate an appropriate number of "other" QA samples (0 to 6) that complement the identity questions ("what is the object" / "what is the part") and improve 3D understanding.
Choose fewer questions for simple objects, and more questions for complex objects. Do NOT force the maximum.
Do NOT duplicate the identity questions.

## Key framing (Teacher → Student)
You have TWO internal roles:
- Teacher (you): You can use ALL inputs (images + part tree summary) to decide what to ask and what the correct answer should be.
- Student (the output): You must write the Think/Answer as if a student is directly inspecting ONLY the 3D object itself (no access to images, part trees, captions, node ids, renders, or any external sources).

The output fields "think" and "answer" MUST be written in the Student voice, while still being correct.

## Critical constraints (Question) — IMPORTANT
- Each question must be clear, concise, and written in English (not overly conversational).
- Keep questions minimally leading: do NOT embed the answer, do NOT provide extra hints, examples, or part lists in the question.
- Questions should focus on understanding the 3D object itself: overall geometry, functional affordances, and relationships among parts that are supported by the input summary.
- Do NOT ask anything that goes beyond the provided part tree summary (names and captions). Avoid brand, manufacturing, precise dimensions, hidden mechanisms, or extra parts not supported by the summary.
- Do NOT ask about material, color, texture, or decoration unless explicitly described in the summary.
- Do NOT mention the part tree, captions, node ids, rendering, or any observation/viewpoint phrasing.
- Avoid directional terms like "left/right/front/back/top/bottom".

## Critical constraints (Think & Answer) — Student voice ONLY
- Each QA must include Question/Think/Answer.
- Think must be 3-6 sentences in English, written as if directly inspecting ONLY the 3D object itself.
- Think MUST NOT mention or imply ANY sources (no: images, views, renders, part tree, summary, captions, node ids, prompts, or "the text says").
- Avoid phrases like: "from the images", "from the views", "the part tree", "the summary", "the caption", "it is described as", "the input states", "confirms".
- Answer must be in English: give a direct answer, then add ONE short intro sentence (≤ 25 words).
- IMPORTANT: The part tree may contain errors. If the tree conflicts with what the object visually looks like, prioritize the object's visual appearance.
- Avoid using double quotes inside Question/Think/Answer strings; rephrase if needed to keep strict JSON valid.

You are an annotation system for generating training data for 3D object understanding. You will receive:
1) Multi-view images (each image: left = clean render, right = highlighted target part for localization only)
2) A part tree with part names and captions (auxiliary context; use it to maintain consistency with the whole object, but do NOT treat it as direct visual evidence)
3) Current target part metadata (node_id / name / caption / parent-child relations)

Generate ONE QA sample answering: "What is this part?"

## Critical constraints (Think & Answer)
- Think must be 4-8 sentences in English. You may use all inputs to infer details, BUT write the Think as if you are directly inspecting ONLY the 3D object and this part itself, with no access to images, highlights, part trees, captions, node ids, or any other external information. Do not mention any sources or how you know.
- Do NOT mention viewpoints, images, the part tree, captions, node ids, observation phrasing, point clouds, highlighted regions, or highlight colors.
- Answer must be in English: first give a clear part category/name, then add ONE short intro sentence (≤ 25 words).
- IMPORTANT: The part tree may contain errors. If the part tree conflicts with what you can infer from the part's visual appearance, prioritize the visual appearance.

## About the images
- In each image, the **left half is the clean render** (use it to describe the real appearance of the part), and the **right half is a point-cloud highlight overlay** (ONLY for locating the part).
- In the right half, different colors indicate different sibling parts; gray indicates other regions.
- You are given 6 images from different viewpoints:
  - Image 1: Front view (azimuth 0°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 2: Right view (azimuth 90°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 3: Back view (azimuth 180°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 4: Left view (azimuth 270°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 5: Front-right top view (azimuth 45°, elevation 45°)
  - Image 6: Back-left top view (azimuth 135°, elevation 45°)

## Sibling parts to annotate

### Part 1 (red)
- Name candidates: ["Display"]
- Child parts: ["Screen", "Casing", "Casing"]

### Part 2 (green)
- Name candidates: ["Stand"]
- Child parts: ["Neck", "Base"]

## Naming guidelines
- The "Name candidates" provided above are preliminary labels that may be inaccurate—they could be too vague, too broad, too narrow, or simply wrong.
- **Your task is to determine the most accurate name based on what you actually see in the images.** The visual appearance is the ground truth.
- If the candidate name is reasonable, you may keep it; if not, provide a better one that precisely describes the highlighted region.

## Output format

You are an annotation system for generating training data for 3D object understanding.
You will receive a part tree summary with part names and captions (auxiliary context).

Task:
- If it is meaningful and unambiguous to ask part-counting questions from the given part tree summary, generate an appropriate number of part-counting QA samples (0 to 3).
- If it is NOT suitable (e.g., the tree summary is too incomplete/ambiguous, or counting would be misleading), output an empty list of qas.
- Choose fewer questions for simple objects, and more questions for complex objects. Do NOT force the maximum.

## Requirements
- Do NOT mention the part tree, captions, node ids, rendering, or any observation/viewpoint phrasing.
- Avoid directional terms like "left/right/front/back/top/bottom".
- The question should be about counts (e.g., number of legs, wheels, spokes, blades, drawers, etc.), but must NOT assume a specific part exists unless it is clearly supported by the tree summary.
- Think must be 3-6 sentences in English. You may use the tree summary to infer details, BUT write the Think as if you are directly inspecting ONLY the 3D object itself, with no access to part trees, captions, or any other external information. Do not mention any sources or how you know.
- Answer must be in English and include the final count explicitly.
- Avoid using double quotes inside Question/Think/Answer strings; rephrase if needed to keep strict JSON valid.

You are an expert annotator for 3D object parts. Please name and describe multiple highlighted sibling parts in the images.

## Context
- Object category/name: Computer monitor
- Parent part name: Monitor Stand

## About the images
- In each image, the **left half is the clean render** (use it to describe the real appearance of the part), and the **right half is a point-cloud highlight overlay** (ONLY for locating the part).
- In the right half, different colors indicate different sibling parts; gray indicates other regions.
- You are given 6 images from different viewpoints:
  - Image 1: Front view (azimuth 0°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 2: Right view (azimuth 90°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 3: Back view (azimuth 180°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 4: Left view (azimuth 270°, elevation 15°)
  - Image 5: Front-right top view (azimuth 45°, elevation 45°)
  - Image 6: Back-left top view (azimuth 135°, elevation 45°)

## Sibling parts to annotate

### Part 1 (red)
- Name candidates: ["Neck"]

### Part 2 (green)
- Name candidates: ["Base"]

## Naming guidelines
- The "Name candidates" provided above are preliminary labels that may be inaccurate—they could be too vague, too broad, too narrow, or simply wrong.
- **Your task is to determine the most accurate name based on what you actually see in the images.** The visual appearance is the ground truth.
- If the candidate name is reasonable, you may keep it; if not, provide a better one that precisely describes the highlighted region.

## Output format
For each part, output the following format (strict order, one block per part):

[Part 1]
Name: <the most accurate part name based on visual appearance, in English>
Caption: <2-4 sentences describing the 3D part itself>

[Part 2]
Name: <the most accurate part name based on visual appearance, in English>
Caption: <2-4 sentences>

... and so on, total 2 parts.

## Critical constraints
- The Caption must be based **strictly on the left clean renders** and describe the real properties of the 3D part itself.
- The description should cover visual appearance, geometric shape, material/finish, structural details, and plausible function.
- Each Caption must be **standalone** and **self-contained**: do NOT refer to any other part or to previous captions. Avoid cross-reference language such as "the first/second", "former/latter", "this/that one", "mirrors", "its sibling", or "as above". Prefer explicit noun phrases that re-identify the part within the caption.
- **Do NOT mention**:
  - anything about the right highlight images (colors, point clouds, highlighted regions, etc.)
  - any viewpoint/observation phrasing (e.g., "from this view", "we can see", "in the image", etc.)
- Write as if describing a real physical part directly, without referencing how it was observed.

--- PROMPT START ---
You are an annotation system for generating training data for 3D object understanding. You will receive:
1) Multi-view rendered images (global views; use them as primary evidence)
2) A part tree summary (auxiliary context; use it to improve global consistency and completeness, but do NOT treat it as direct visual evidence)

Goal:
Generate an appropriate number of "other" QA samples (0 to 6) that complement the identity questions ("what is the object" / "what is the part") and improve 3D understanding.
Choose fewer questions for simple objects, and more questions for complex objects. Do NOT force the maximum.
Do NOT duplicate the identity questions.

## Key framing (Teacher → Student)
You have TWO internal roles:
- Teacher (you): You can use ALL inputs (images + part tree summary) to decide what to ask and what the correct answer should be.
- Student (the output): You must write the Think/Answer as if a student is directly inspecting ONLY the 3D object itself (no access to images, part trees, captions, node ids, renders, or any external sources).

The output fields "think" and "answer" MUST be written in the Student voice, while still being correct.

## Critical constraints (Question) — IMPORTANT
- Each question must be clear, concise, and written in English (not overly conversational).
- Keep questions minimally leading: do NOT embed the answer, do NOT provide extra hints, examples, or part lists in the question.
- Questions should focus on understanding the 3D object itself: overall geometry, functional affordances, and relationships among parts that are supported by the input summary.
- Do NOT ask anything that goes beyond the provided part tree summary (names and captions). Avoid brand, manufacturing, precise dimensions, hidden mechanisms, or extra parts not supported by the summary.
- Do NOT ask about material, color, texture, or decoration unless explicitly described in the summary.
- Do NOT mention the part tree, captions, node ids, rendering, or any observation/viewpoint phrasing.
- Avoid directional terms like "left/right/front/back/top/bottom".

## Critical constraints (Think & Answer) — Student voice ONLY
- Each QA must include Question/Think/Answer.
- Think must be 3-6 sentences in English, written as if directly inspecting ONLY the 3D object itself.
- Think MUST NOT mention or imply ANY sources (no: images, views, renders, part tree, summary, captions, node ids, prompts, or "the text says").
- Avoid phrases like: "from the images", "from the views", "the part tree", "the summary", "the caption", "it is described as", "the input states", "confirms".
- Answer must be in English: give a direct answer, then add ONE short intro sentence (≤ 25 words).
- IMPORTANT: The part tree may contain errors. If the tree conflicts with what the object visually looks like, prioritize the object's visual appearance.
- Avoid using double quotes inside Question/Think/Answer strings; rephrase if needed to keep strict JSON valid.

  - id=6 parent=0 name=Monitor Stand children=["Neck", "Base"] caption=The monitor stand consists of a flat, trapezoidal base with a brushed metallic finish and a cylindrical neck that connects vertically to the display assembly. The base provides stable support on a desk surface, while the neck allows for height and tilt adjustment. Both components are constructed from rigid metal materials, giving the stand a sturdy and minimalist industrial appearance.
    - id=7 parent=6 name=Neck children=[] caption=The neck is a slender, vertically oriented structural column that connects the monitor display to the base. It has a smooth, matte gray finish and a rectangular cross-section with slightly rounded edges. Its primary function is to elevate the screen to an ergonomic viewing height while maintaining stability. The geometry is consistent across all viewing angles, indicating a rigid, non-articulated support.
    - id=8 parent=6 name=Base children=[] caption=The base is a wide, flat, trapezoidal platform with a matte gray surface and subtly beveled edges, designed for stability on a desk. It features a low-profile, angular form that tapers slightly toward the center where it meets the neck. The material appears solid and dense, suggesting it provides counterbalance to the monitor’s weight. Its broad footprint ensures the entire assembly remains upright during use.

--- PROMPT START ---
You are an annotation system for generating training data for 3D object understanding.
You will receive a part tree summary with part names and captions (auxiliary context).

Task:
- If it is meaningful and unambiguous to ask part-counting questions from the given part tree summary, generate an appropriate number of part-counting QA samples (0 to 3).
- If it is NOT suitable (e.g., the tree summary is too incomplete/ambiguous, or counting would be misleading), output an empty list of qas.
- Choose fewer questions for simple objects, and more questions for complex objects. Do NOT force the maximum.

## Requirements
- Do NOT mention the part tree, captions, node ids, rendering, or any observation/viewpoint phrasing.
- Avoid directional terms like "left/right/front/back/top/bottom".
- The question should be about counts (e.g., number of legs, wheels, spokes, blades, drawers, etc.), but must NOT assume a specific part exists unless it is clearly supported by the tree summary.
- Think must be 3-6 sentences in English. You may use the tree summary to infer details, BUT write the Think as if you are directly inspecting ONLY the 3D object itself, with no access to part trees, captions, or any other external information. Do not mention any sources or how you know.
- Answer must be in English and include the final count explicitly.
- Avoid using double quotes inside Question/Think/Answer strings; rephrase if needed to keep strict JSON valid.

2) A part tree with part names and captions (auxiliary context; use it to maintain consistency with the whole object, but do NOT treat it as direct visual evidence)
3) Current target part metadata (node_id / name / caption / parent-child relations)

Generate ONE QA sample answering: "What is this part?"

## Critical constraints (Think & Answer)
- Think must be 4-8 sentences in English. You may use all inputs to infer details, BUT write the Think as if you are directly inspecting ONLY the 3D object and this part itself, with no access to images, highlights, part trees, captions, node ids, or any other external information. Do not mention any sources or how you know.
- Do NOT mention viewpoints, images, the part tree, captions, node ids, observation phrasing, point clouds, highlighted regions, or highlight colors.
- Answer must be in English: first give a clear part category/name, then add ONE short intro sentence (≤ 25 words).
- IMPORTANT: The part tree may contain errors. If the part tree conflicts with what you can infer from the part's visual appearance, prioritize the visual appearance.
